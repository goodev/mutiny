"""Models for Mutiny backend.

In San Francisco, the degrees of latitude and longitude roughly translate into
these distances on the ground:

0.00001 = 1 meters = 3.2 feet
0.0001 = 10 meters = 32 feet
0.0002 = 20 meters = 65 feet
0.0005 = 50 meters = 165 feet
0.001 = 100 meters = 330 feet
0.002 = 200 meters = 660 feet = 0.125 miles
0.005 = 500 meters = 1,640 feet = 0.3 miles
0.008 = 800 meters = 2,625 feet = 0.5 miles
0.016 = 1600 meters = 5,250 feet = 1.0 miles
0.05 = 5000 meters = 16,400 feet = 3.1 miles

We'll use all of these various resolutions to allow for scanning for bus stops
at different levels of resolution.
